# [Mike] Note that I switched to (mu,kappa) instead of (E,nu).
#        nu is especially problematic. It is better to work with mu and kappa
#        Case in point: if nu=0.5, this corresponds to an incompressible material.
#        Incompressibility requires that kappa --> infinity, which is problematic
#        for the solver.

# [Mike] Also, notice that I reduced the order of magnitude of the elastic moduli.
#        It helps the solver to use units with magnitude on the order of 10 or so.
